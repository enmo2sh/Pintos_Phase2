# Pintos-phase2
Pintos is a simple operating system that is developed at Stanford University.  
More information about pintos and installation environment is available here [Stanford Pintos Introduction](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1)  

### Phase2: Multiprogramming
The base code for loading and running user programs is already supported, but no I/O or interactivity is possible.  
This phase aims to enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls, allowing more than one process to run at a time.  
Each process has one thread.  
More information about Phase2 is available here [Phase2: Multiprogramming](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_3.html#SEC32)
